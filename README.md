# robotic-arm-with-NiTi-Alloy-grippers
This is a CAD file for a 6-Axis industrial robot commonly used in manufacturing industries. The grippers can be modeled with Nitinol alloy for it's shape memory property. I am attaching the COMSOL file for the said material with all the uniaxial loading conditions tested using Souza Auricchio model.
